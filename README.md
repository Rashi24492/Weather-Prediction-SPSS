# Weather-Prediction-SPSS
This project focus on weather prediction using IBM SPSS Modeler.The project aims to analyse the weather conditions.  
We used historical weather data to predict 5 types of weather:  

- 🌦 Drizzle  
- 🌁 Fog  
- ☀️ Sunny  
- 🌧 Rain  
- ❄️ Snow  

We used **CHAID modeling** to make these predictions.

## What I Did
- Explored the weather data (temperature, wind, precipitation)  
- Cleaned and prepared the data in IBM SPSS Modeler  
- Built a **CHAID model** to predict weather  
- Checked results using tables and filters  

---

## Tools Used
- IBM SPSS Modeler  
- CSV dataset  
- CHAID algorithm  
- PowerPoint (for presentation)

---

## How It Works
1. Load the CSV weather data  
2. Check the data types and statistics  
3. Run the CHAID model  
4. Filter results for each weather type  
5. View predictions in tables  

---

## 📌 Key Learnings
- Practical use of **CHAID modeling**
- Weather data interpretation
- End-to-end model building in IBM SPSS Modeler
- Decision-tree-based classification understanding

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Compare CHAID with other models (C5.0, Random Forest)  
- Add accuracy and performance metrics  
- Integrate visualization dashboards  
- Deploy as a web-based weather prediction system
